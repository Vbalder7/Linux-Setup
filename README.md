# Personal Linux Setup

Every time I boot into a fresh install of Linux, I automatically start thinking of what I have to
download to have the best experience. Well I decided to just make some bash
scripts that just do it for me so here it is.

## Fresh-Install Programs

+ Git (If you want to use this then you schould change the git config in the fres-install file)
+ Neofetch
+ Htop
+ Gnome-Terminal
+ VLC
+ Nano
+ Whois
+ Snap
+ Java (jre)
+ Java (jdk)
+ LibreOffice
+ Firefox
+ Python3
+ Git Desktop
+ VS Code

# Custom Terminal

+ Fancygit

  + Setup the way I like it
